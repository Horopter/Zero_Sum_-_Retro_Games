# Zero_Sum_-_Retro_Games
Recreation of classic games. Inspired from various tutorials.
Contains some of my own creation too.

1. Tic Tac Toe : C'mon don't tell me you didn't play it. (Android game)
2. Towers of Brahma : A great math puzzle with a deep myth.
(HTML5/CSS3/JS/jQuery[ok I copied jQuery part, but hey, game sure will look nicer.])
3. RFD - WebGL version : My first new game inspired from space invaders but better. Still in development. Hang on. Meanwhile see my Desktop version. (HTML5/CSS3/WebGL/JS)
4. Christmas 2048 : Attended a tutorial on youtube to create this bad boy. (HTML5/CSS3/JS)
