# Zero_Sum_-_Retro_Games
Recreation of classic games. Inspired from various tutorials.

1. Tic Tac Toe : C'mon don't tell me you didn't play it. (Android game)
2. Towers of Brahma : A great math puzzle with a deep myth.
(HTML5/CSS3/JS/jQuery[ok I copied jQuery part, but hey, game sure will look nicer.])

Check out both of my games at
